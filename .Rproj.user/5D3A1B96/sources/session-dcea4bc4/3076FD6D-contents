### Milestone #1 Objective

Choose scenario and create git repo; define roles and responsibilities within the group.

#### **Milestone #1 Details**

Please push to GitHub an html document or a PDF (knitted/rendered from an Rmd or Qmd) with the following information

-   Project option selection

-   A link to your group’s git repository

-   Write out your roles and responsibilities. In a meeting, define these using the "prompts to help define roles and responsibilities within your team" below.

    -   Team's preferred communication method 

    -   Team's preferred meeting times and frequency 

    -   Team's preferred method for tracking progress

    -   Point person for contacting course facilitators with questions

#### **Additionally, please do the following:**

-   Ensure each group member has made at least one commit to the repository

-   Add the teaching team as collaborators to your repository (instructions in the ["How to Turn In Milestone Assignments"](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546358/pages/team-project#S6 "Team Project") section of this page)

### **Prompts to help define roles and responsibilities within your team**

Meeting Planning

-   What is your team's preferred communication method - email, text, bcourse messaging?

-   When will your team be holding meetings? How frequently will you meet? Are there times or days that work well for everyone?

-   Discuss future non-academic commitments that might affect members' availability.

-   Discuss meeting tempo: “checking in” at the beginning of meetings versus “just sticking to business”.

Roles

-   How is your team going to keep track of progress? Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?

-   We encourage you to discuss potential dates and times to meet with a course facilitator during Weeks 3-5. Decide on the best date and time for all.

Conflict Management

-   If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).

-   If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team. 

```{r}

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
